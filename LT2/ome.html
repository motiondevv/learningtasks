    <p><b>Ingredients</b></p>
    <ul>
    <li>3
Eggs</li>
    <li>Salt
and
Pepper</li>
    <li>Butter</li>
    <li>Grated
cheese
(optional)</li>
    <li>Mixed

(optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Method</b></p>
    <p>1)
Mix
the
eggs
in
any
sort
of
bowl
or
jug
you
like
(a
pint
glass
works
well!)
with
salt,
pepper
and
herbs
if
desired.<br>
2)
Heat
the
butter
(or
oil)
in
a
reasonably
large
frying
pan.<br>
3)
Pour
in
the
egg
mixture
slowly
and
swirl
the
pan
a
little
to
even
it
out.<br>
4)
After
30
seconds
or
so
the
top
should
firm
up,
at
this
point
add
grated
cheese
if
you
like.<br>
5)
Continue
cooking
a
little
until
the
cheese
begins
to
melt,
then
fold
the
omelette
in
half
with
a
bendy
spatula<br>
6)
If
its
nice
and
cooked
on
the
bottom
already
then
serve,
otherwise,
continue
cooking
on
each
side
a
little
more!<br><br>
Sometimes
I
make
an
omelette
with
loads
of
onions,
chopped
sausages
and
vegetables
in.
If
you
do
this
then
you
probably
wont
be
able
to
fold
it
so
instead,
pop
the
pan
under
a
grill
to
finish
the
top
off
after
its
cooked
underneath!
