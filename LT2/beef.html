    <img src="beef.jpg">
    <p><b>Ingredients</b></p>
    <ul>
    <li>500g of cheap beef pieces (stewing steak usually cheap)</li>
    <li>500 mls of real ale</li>
    <li>4 large onions</li>
    <li>2 fat cloves of garlic</li>
    <li>tbsp of plain flour</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Method</b></p>
    <p>Raw beef, roll it in the flour...fry 4-5 pieces at a time in a hot saucepan to seal...put to one side when all done<br><br>
        cut the onions into quarters...fry in the same frying pan as the beef... to soak up the juices...<br><br>
        Towards the end of frying the onion (they should be nicely brown round the edges) throw in the smashed up cloves of garlic.<br><br>
        Transfer the beef, onions, garlic to a deep casserole dish. Stir in the remaining flour<br><br>
        pour on the bottle of beer - really, it isn't going to be wasted!!!<br><br>
        Cover, and cook at 150 for about 2 and a half hours... will be gorgeous when it comes out, trust me... serve with mash
